# Nutrition-Clients-Bash
Using Bash, I created a calorie calculator that can create a CSV file which contains the clients (each one having an auto-generated ID), that can delete a record receiving as entry date the ID without altering the rest of recordings and that can sort them.

Inside "adaugareClient.sh" file I used the *bc* command and if you try to run the program on Windows, you'll get an error because Windows doesn't recognize this specific command. Run the scripts on Linux.
